# About Me

I am a postdoctoral researcher working with Professor John T. Hwang in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at UC San Diego, where I am affiliated with the Large-Scale Design Optimization (LSDO) Lab since 2024. I obtained my Ph.D. from UC Davis under the guidance of Professor Seongkyu Lee.

My research focuses on aeroacoustics and aerodynamic shape optimization using computational fluid dynamics, aiming to study the fundamental mechanism of noise sources in turbulent flows and optimize the aircraft shape and design.
